# Metro Curbside Cleaning

## Application Value
We have decided to take on a client who is looking to update their current website. The current website is a basic HTML and CSS website that displays the services and contact information for Metro Curbside Cleaning. We'd like to take on the challenge of revamping the websit to make it look more appealing, as well as add in admin and user functionality. The admin page will allow the admin to update content of the page by storing it within a MongoDB. This will include the content of the home page, contact information and pricing. This allows the admin to change content of the page without having to contact the developers. 

The user page will give users the capability of scheduling their services as well as pay their invoices. Each user will be associated with a Zoho ID that will allow the user to access their account information, including outstanding invoices and scheduled services. 

We are excited to work on the project as it adds value to a specific client's business. We will be able to present a website that will hopefully increase the traffic for Metro Curbside Cleaning.
